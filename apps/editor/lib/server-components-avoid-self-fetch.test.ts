/**
 * A Server Component calling this app's own HTTP API sends the request back
 * out through the proxy, drops the caller's cookies (so it 401s the moment
 * sessions exist), and in a multi-replica deployment can land on a different
 * replica than the one rendering the page. On `/scene/[id]` it also carried
 * the whole 300 KB–10 MB graph over HTTP before rendering it into the RSC
 * payload.
 *
 * The store is a per-process singleton (`lib/scene-store-server.ts`), so these
 * pages call it directly. This test is here because the fetch version *works*
 * in a single-replica dev box — nothing fails until deploy or login, by which
 * point the cause is far away.
